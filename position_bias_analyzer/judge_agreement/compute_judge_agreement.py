'''
These function calculates and visualizes the judge mutual agreement matrix.

The input data should have choices extracted (i.e., should have columns named as extracted_{judge})

Judge agreement is only calcualted for both successful extraction.

save_to_file, when specified, would save the agreement matrix to it; otherwise, it'll print the results to console.
